## A Good Disclosure

When submitting a Vulnerability Report, please include as much relevant
information as possible:

- The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site
  scripting).
- Impacted version(s) of the project.
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue.
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL).
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
- Any log files that are related to this issue (if possible).
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible).

You will never share too much information to us.

## After Submission

Once reviewed, the clock begins for us. We will begin to validate the
submission, assess the impact, and release a timeline of resolution and
disclosure. Below is the general guidelines of this process:

This is a passion project. Subject to availability.

1. Maintainers will acknowledge the submission and validate the claim. Process
   date starts at acknowledgement.
2. Maintainers will research the scope, impact, and severity of the claim.
3. Maintainers will begin work on analysis and possible mitigation of the
   reported issue.
4. Maintainers will release an update addressing the issue; if applicable.
5. Maintainers will release a statement and update the disclosure based on
   analysis, mitigation, and how/if it was addressed.
6. Maintainers will publish the disclosure to the public after mitigation
   is completed.

- When a fix is deployed, a disclosure will be published within 5 business days days or
  30 days of the initial submission process date; whichever is earliest.
- If a vulnerability exists and it not yet patched, a disclosure will be
  published within 30 days of submission processing unless mutually agreed upon
  to extend the disclosure window for public interest.
